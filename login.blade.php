                                        Fixed Issue #26 addressing a where a character utilizing a grant url to authorize another character access to their data. The system was not taking into consideration the scopes that the user had grant the application to access when registered and was just blanket approving every scope in the grant. This resulted in access to pages on the user that the user never granted access to when registering with the site.
