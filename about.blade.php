                                ESIKnife is a version of the famous Jackknife application that was built on top of CCP's XML/Crest API. This one is built on top of CCP's new API, the Eve Swagger Interface, better known as ESI (pronounced as "easy").

                                    As I mentioned, Jackknife was an application that was built ontop of CCP's XML/Crest API. It allows a player to share information about their character(s) with any other character in game without having to give away usernames and passwords or any tedious screenshots/copy pasta. It is/was a very common tool used amount corporation recruiters/ceo's to audit/evaluate a character prior to allowing them to join their corporation.

                                ESIKnife was built for two reasons.
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        I built ESIKnife as a replacement for Jackknife. No viable replacement's were publicaly in the works as the deadline for the shutdown of the XML/Crest API's approached. About a month before this, I started work on ESIKnife. Real life prevented me from finishing the application on time and some serious design flaw's in the first version pushed the release of the application back even further.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        I built it because it was a challenge. I do not program IRL professionally. All of my programming is purely done as a hobby in my free time. Some would say it is a bad addiction that I have. That is good for you guys, sometimes bad for me :-)
